This set of sample applications is designed to demonstrate the three primary methods that are available to connect to the ProjectSight API and to demonstrate some basic functionality and some more advanced techniques.

ProjectSight.API.SampleApp is for applications that use TID v4 to connect to API applications hosted in API-X (https://api.trimblepaas.com). This is the most applicable sample for most API consumers.

ProjectSight.API.SampleApp.CloudV2 is for applications use API applications hosted in Cloud v2 (https://console.trimble.com/home). This API host is only available to Trimble employees at this time. However, there are some integrations that are hosted in Cloud v2, such as that used to integrate ProjectSight with Viewpoint applications.

The Postman folder contains a simple getting started collection.

For all of the sample applications, you will need to log into ProjectSight (https://prod.projectsightapp.trimble.com) at least once.

This login will require that you create a user in Trimble Identity if you don't already have one.

For all new applications, you will also need to contact ProjectSight support. 

The full set of steps needed to get up and running with the ProjectSight API can be found here: https://prod.projectsightapp.trimble.com/ReleaseNotes/Content/Release-Notes/API/API-Access.htm
